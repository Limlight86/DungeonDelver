My week 2 project for Wyncode. Its inspired by old school MUD RPGs. I wanted to make it even more complex, with added functionality giving the player characters special moves and the ability to move through the dungeon forwards and backwards and to have the comabt rounds be round by round choices as opposed to it being fully automated until there was a winner. I will probably keep working on this as time goes on as a pet project. I had lots of fun making this and learned a great deal about how Javascript works.
